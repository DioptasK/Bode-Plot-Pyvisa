## üîß Features

- **Device Detection** ‚Äì finds and configures connected VISA devices.
- **Data Plot in Display** ‚Äì visual representation of measurement results.
- **Settings Management** ‚Äì GUI for application settings.
- **Integrated Terminal** ‚Äì embedded console output.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Run with CLI options:

```bash
python3 main.py [-options]
```

### Run with GUI:

```bash
python3 main.py -u
```

## Device Setup

### Enter Device IDs Manually
You can directly enter the VISA ID of your oscilloscope and/or function generator in the respective fields `Scope` and `Signagenerator`.

### Find Connected Devices
Alternatively, click the **"Get Devices"** button to scan for connected instruments.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your user account has access to the corresponding interface (e.g., USB, Ethernet, etc.).
**For USB devices**, you can check and adjust access permissions using:

```bash
lsusb
sudo chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/003/019
```
> Replace `003` and `019` with the bus and device numbers from the `lsusb` output.

### Function Generator via Scope
If your scope has a built-in function generator, you may only need to enter the scope‚Äôs ID.  
The program will automatically use the internal generator if available.

### Select Manufacturer
‚ö†Ô∏è Choose the instrument manufacturer.  
**Default:** `Siglent`.

### Set Probe Attenuation
Adjust the probe attenuation according to your probe setup.  
**Default:** `10x`.

---

## Measurement Setup

### Sweep Type
- `"lin"`: Linear sweep ‚Äì divides the frequency range into equal steps.  
- `"exp"`: Exponential sweep ‚Äì steps grow exponentially over the range.

### Samples
Set the number of measurement points across the entire frequency range.

---

## Run the Measurement

1. Click **"Check"** to validate all input parameters.
2. If validation passes, click **"Start"** to begin the measurement.
3. Results will be:
   - Printed in the terminal.
   - Plotted in a new window after the sweep is completed.

---

## Exporting Results

After the measurement is complete, click **"Export CSV"** to save the results as a `.csv` file.
